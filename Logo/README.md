# Logo 

This directory simply contains the logo used in Sonic: Lock & Load in Inkscape SVG, specifically the version used in v1.4 "Horizons."

It's a separate directory for organisation purposes.

You need both the [NiseSegaSonic](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/nise-sega-sonic-font/) and [Vipnagorgialla](https://www.dafont.com/vipnagorgialla.font) fonts to display this logo correctly.
