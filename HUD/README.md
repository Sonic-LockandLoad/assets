# HUDs

Contains the Unified HUD in Inkscape SVG format for all characters.

Classic-Style and Legacy HUD are handled entirely in code and don't use external images.

In-game, the images are PNG, but the source files are Inkscape SVG which is what's used here.

You need the [Vipnagorgialla](https://www.dafont.com/vipnagorgialla.font) font to be able to properly see these in Inkscape.
